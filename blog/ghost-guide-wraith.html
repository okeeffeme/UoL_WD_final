            <p id="1">The Wraith is one of the most unique and dangerous ghosts you’ll encounter. Known for its ability to float and phase through walls, it challenges the normal rules of ghost hunting. In this post, we’ll break down the Wraith’s traits, how to identify it, and the best strategies to survive its encounters.</p>

            <h2 id="2">Overview: What is a Wraith?</h2>
            <p>The Wraith stands out as one of the most feared entities in modern ghost hunting. Unlike most ghosts, it has the eerie ability to never touch the ground, meaning it doesn’t leave footprints behind when it walks. This makes tracking it with salt nearly impossible, as it will pass over it without disturbing it. The Wraith can also move through walls, making its hunts unpredictable and often catching players off guard.</p>
            <p>Because of its unique movement abilities, the Wraith feels more elusive than other ghost types, making it a tricky foe for investigators.</p>

            <h2 id="3">Evidence: How to Identify It</h2>
            <p>To identify a Wraith, you’ll need to gather three specific pieces of evidence:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>EMF Level 5: The EMF Reader will spike to level 5 when close to the Spirit's activity.</li>
            <li>Spirit Box: If you communicate with the ghost using the Spirit Box, it will respond to your questions.</li>
            <li>Dots Projector: A Wraith can manifest through the Dots Projector, allowing you to see its ghostly form briefly pass through.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These clues are crucial, but what really sets the Wraith apart is its lack of interaction with salt. If the ghost does not leave footprints after walking over salt piles, it’s a strong indicator that you’re dealing with a Wraith.</p>

            <h2 id="4">Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
            <p>The Wraith’s floating ability gives it unique strengths, making it more difficult to track and avoid. However, like all ghosts, it has certain weaknesses that players can exploit.</p>
            <p>Strengths: The Wraith won’t leave UV-visible footprints in salt, which makes it harder to track its movement compared to other ghosts. The Wraith can also occasionally teleport to the player’s location, potentially setting up a quick ambush.</p>
            <p>Weakness: While the Wraith can pass over salt without leaving footprints, it is still repelled by salt. If you place salt down, the Wraith will avoid those areas, allowing you to control its movement.</p>
            <h2 id="5">Key Tips</h2>
            <p>Use Salt to Your Advantage: Although it won’t leave footprints, placing salt can still help you. The Wraith won’t interact with it, so when salt is undisturbed, it’s a strong hint of its identity. Additionally, salt can help corral the Wraith during hunts, creating safe zones.</p>

            <p>Stay Alert for Teleportation: Wraiths have a unique ability to teleport to random players, sometimes without triggering a hunt. This can catch players off guard and lead to dangerous encounters. Stay vigilant, even if the ghost isn’t nearby, as it can suddenly appear at your location.</p>

            <p>Rely on the Dots Projector and Spirit Box: Wraiths are highly interactive with the Dots Projector, often appearing briefly. Combine this with the Spirit Box, which is a surefire way to communicate with the Wraith, to quickly gather evidence.</p>

            <p>Protect Yourself During Hunts: Wraiths, like other ghosts, become lethal once your team’s sanity drops. Use Crucifixes and Smudge Sticks to prevent hunts or give yourself more time to escape if things go wrong.</p>

            <p>Don’t Be Fooled by Footsteps: While you won’t see UV footprints from a Wraith, you can still hear its footsteps when it walks. Use this to help gauge its location, even though it won’t leave visible signs.</p>

            <h2 id="6">Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>The Wraith is a deadly combination of elusiveness and power. Its ability to teleport and float through walls makes it one of the more unpredictable ghost types, but with the right strategies, you can outsmart it. Rely on salt, the Spirit Box, and the DOTS Projector to uncover its identity while staying alert for its sudden appearances.</p>

            <p>Whether you're a seasoned investigator or a new ghost hunter, facing a Wraith is always a thrilling and tense experience. Make sure to plan your moves carefully and always stay one step ahead—because the Wraith is never far behind.</p>
