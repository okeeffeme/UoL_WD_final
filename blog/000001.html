            <p id="1">Phasmophobia is filled with terrifying ghosts that can make your heart race, but one of the most
            common yet dangerous entities you'll encounter is the Spirit. Despite being labeled as a more "standard"
            ghost, do not underestimate it. In this post, we'll explore the traits, evidence, and best strategies
            for dealing with a Spirit in Phasmophobia.</p>

            <h2 id="2">Overview: What is a Spirit?</h2>
            <p>In the game, the Spirit is described as a common ghost type, but its unpredictability can make it deadly
            in certain situations. Unlike other ghost types with specific strengths or weaknesses, the Spirit is
            fairly balanced and doesn’t rely on special abilities to hunt or confuse players. This makes it both
            easier and trickier to deal with—it behaves more consistently than some of the other, more aggressive
            ghosts, but that also means you can’t rely on any unique habits to identify it quickly.</p>

            <h2 id="3">Evidence: How to Identify It</h2>
            <p>When trying to figure out whether you're dealing with a Spirit, you'll need to collect three specific
            pieces of evidence:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>EMF Level 5: The EMF Reader will spike to level 5 when close to the Spirit's activity.</li>
            <li>Spirit Box: If you communicate with the ghost using the Spirit Box, it will respond to your questions.</li>
            <li>Ghost Writing: Place a ghostwriting book in an active area, and if the Spirit interacts with it, it will leave a message.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This combination of evidence is key to confirming a Spirit’s presence. It's important to note that the
            Spirit doesn’t have any special features like freezing temperatures or orbs, so you’ll need to rely on
            more basic tools to gather evidence.</p>

            <h2 id="4">Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
            <p>While the Spirit doesn’t have unique strengths like other ghost types, it does have a notable weakness:
            it can be stopped from hunting for a long time with the use of Smudge Sticks.</p>

            <p>Weakness: Using Smudge Sticks near a Spirit will prevent it from initiating a hunt for 180 seconds (3
            minutes). This gives you a significant window to gather evidence, communicate with your team, and plan
            your next move.</p>
            <h2 id="5">Key Tips</h2>
            <p>Bring Smudge Sticks: As mentioned, Smudge Sticks are your best defense against a Spirit. Once you’ve
            confirmed the ghost type, use them strategically to give yourself some breathing room. Smudging near the
            Spirit will temporarily calm it down, allowing you to continue your investigation without fear of a
            hunt.</p>

            <p>Use Basic Tools: Since Spirits don’t rely on unique abilities, tools like the EMF Reader, Spirit Box, and
            Ghost Writing Book are the most reliable ways to gather evidence. Focus on monitoring activity with
            these tools and avoid wasting time on gadgets like the Thermometer or D.O.T.S. Projector.</p>

            <p>Stay Together: Spirits can hunt when the sanity level drops, and they tend to be lethal once they start
            hunting. Staying together and keeping your sanity high by using sanity pills can minimize the chances of
            a deadly encounter.</p>

            <p>Don’t Let Its Simplicity Fool You: Spirits may not have flashy powers, but they can still be dangerous.
            Don’t get too comfortable during your investigation just because it seems “normal”—the Spirit can still
            surprise you with aggressive hunts if you're unprepared.</p>

            <h2 id="6">Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>The Spirit may be one of the most common ghosts in Phasmophobia, but that doesn’t mean it’s harmless. By
            understanding its evidence, utilizing Smudge Sticks effectively, and keeping your wits about you, you
            can outsmart this ghost and make it out alive. Just remember, even the most "basic" ghost can become a
            nightmare if you're not careful.</p>
