            <blockquote>What is the essential story being told by your portfolio site? Describe the version of you that it is about.</blockquote>
            
            <p>In 2034, ghosts are an epidemic haunting homes and businesses. Systems have been put into place to identify and expunge these otherworldly presences. Identification specialists are a required first-step in requesting a licensed and insured ghost remediation.</p>
            <p>NameTBD is a Ghost Identification Specialist, licensed thru Ghost Investigators and Graveyard Scouts (GIGS). Their main line of work is to identify ghosts and gather evidence in hauntings, passing their findings off to a GIGS cleanup team.</p>
            <p>This future has largely been inspired by the series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockwood_%26_Co.">Lockwood & Co.</a> and the video game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phasmophobia_(video_game)">Phasmaphobia</a>. All ghost types and mechanics described on the site are direct references to their video game versions.</p>
            <blockquote>What is the audience you are addressing? What type of structure did you choose to implement?</blockquote>
            <p>Vistors to the site want help with their ghost-related problems. They are looking for quick, reliable, and GIGS-certified assistance to resolve their hauntings.</p>
            <p>To assure the visitor on NameTBD's reliablity, links to accreditation and affidavits are avalible on the 'About' page. GIGS mandated reports serve as NameTBD's portfolio of successfully solved cases. NameTBD also writes blog articles relevant to their work, and has also provided a Quick ID page to help them triage potential cases.</p>

                    <p>I am a long-time fan of Lynn Fisher, and frequently reference her project 'A Single Div'. Fisher updates her portfolio about once a year; the site is, in itself, a showcase of her CSS ability.</p>

                    <p>Josh is a great developer, and I use his CSS reset almost exlusively. His personal portfolio site is a bit of an outlier, as it focuses mainly on his tutorials and articles with very little about himself (although some of his content does focus on himself and his personal experiences).</p>

            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4><s>All</s> About Me</h4>
                    <p>The 'About' sections were less of a CV, and more of an overview of interests and published work (or talks). Josh forwent an 'About' section entirely.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Blogs</h4>
                    <p>Everyone is blogging. Each site includes a RSS feed, and there's a good number of posts on each site within the past year. Subject matter is a mixture of professional and personal interest.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Cool tidbits</h4>
                    <p>Each author's personality is showcased on their site. There are cute additions like Josh's avatar popping out from the side. Dave has a 'Star Wars crawl' inspired landing page, and has included his current reading list in the topline navigation. Lynn's entire site is just cool CSS. She also has a shop for her designs, and a page specifically for CSS gifs she's created.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I am definitely straying a bit from a developer's website with my chosen persona. Because of the nature of my fantastical subject matter, I aim to incorporate these findings but also focus on the report's prompt of 'What is the audience you are addressing?'</p>
            <p>While most of the inspiration sites were light on their 'About' pages, NameTBD will need a more robust 'About' page to reassure their potential clientele that they are capable and qualified. This will include their GIGS certification number and accreditations.</p>
            <p>I will be implementing blog posts, as a site visitor might be interested in reading about ghosts, hauntings, and other related topics. In addition, in this universe GIGS certified hunters are required to write and publish case reports for each ghost identified. These cases will be published on NameTBD's site.</p>
            <p>For a fun addition, visitors might want to quickly diagnose their hauntings. A 'Quick ID' checklist will be avalible for site visitors to hopefully gather more information about their haunting. In-universe, this also helps with triaging the haunting.</p>
            <a id="accessibility"><h2>Accessibility</h2></a>
            <blockquote>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</blockquote>
            <p>I'll be focusing on clear, keyboard driven navigation, semantic html with media descriptions, and toggles for animations.</p>
            <a id="usability"><h2>Usability</h2></a>
            <blockquote>State 3 ways in which you considered the usability of your site.</blockquote>
            <p>I've considered the target audience's main goals will be to contact NameTBD, validate NameTBD's accreditation and competence, and find solace in other cases that were resolved. All of these motivators will be addressed via top level navigation for ease of access.</p>
            <p>In looking at Josh's site, I found the HTML structure of his blog posts fantastic. Each post title is a h1 tag, each article has a table of contents in an aside, each subheader has an anchor. I am directly referencing his layout when designing my own. This structure gives a clear overview to the contents of the article, and helps readers quickly navigate to content that is the most relevant to them.</p>
            <a id="learning"><h2>Learning</h2></a>
            <blockquote>State 3 things you had to learn or find out to create your site. How did you achieve that?</blockquote>
            
            <p>There were several components where I wanted to guarantee that the HTML was both the most semantically correct <em>and</em> accessible. Quotations and testimonials, for example, are not components that I've used frequently. My go-to for most component compositions is <a href="">CSS Tricks</a>, and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/quoting-in-html-quotations-citations-and-blockquotes/">this article by John Rhea</a> provided good insight into best practice.</p>

            <p>I had ChatGPT generate the blog posts on <time datetime="2007-08-29T13:58Z"> August 29th, 2007 at 13:58</time>. The prompt was as follows:</p>
            <p>write a blog post about a phasmophobia spirit</p>
            <p>This prompt was used for each ghost type.</p>
